Flight Delay Prediction
INTRODUCTION
In the dynamic landscape of air travel, the occurrence of flight delays poses significant challenges to both passengers and airline operators. Addressing this issue requires cutting-edge technology and predictive analytics. This project aims to develop a Flight Delay Prediction system leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of predicting flight delays and minimize disruptions in air travel.


PROJECT SCOPE
The scope of this project encompasses the analysis of historical flight data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors to build a robust prediction model. The system will offer real-time predictions, empowering airlines and passengers to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of potential delays.


ABOUT THE COMPANY
